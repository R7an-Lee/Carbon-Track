        "tipsContent": "1. Stay at half. Keep at least a half-tank of fuel during cold winter months, and when there is a risk of shortages, say, due to a lack of gasoline delivery drivers to meet travel demands, or when a major storm or hurricane is imminent. This tip also goes for holiday road trips, when roads can be congested and slow-moving. Having plenty of gas onboard can ease stress and give you more flexibility with when and where you fill up.                            2. Check online. Apps and websites such as GasBuddy can show local gas prices, making it easy to find good prices in your area or if you need to travel. Generally, gas stations well off major highways and away from city centers tend to have better prices, as do warehouse stores and some major travel centers.                                                                           3. Minimize travel. If you can delay errands or other activities, you will preserve the gas that you purchased and reduce overall consumption for the region, helping in some small way to reduce the gas scarcity. "
